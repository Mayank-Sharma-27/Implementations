## Question 1
**Question file:** bank.py
Stripe-Style Multi-Part Problem: Bank Deposit Reconciliation

This problem simulates the reconciliation of a single, consolidated bank
deposit against a list of outstanding customer invoices. The goal is to
correctly apply payments and manage balances for partial or overpayments.

Inputs:
- `deposit_data`: A single string representing the deposit, formatted as:
  `deposit_id|customer_id:amount_paid:invoice_id|...`
- `outstanding_invoices`: A list of strings for open invoices, formatted as:
  `invoice_id,customer_id,amount_due`

---

Part 1: Exact Reconciliation
- Process payments that exactly match the invoice's amount due.

Part 2: Handling Partial Payments
- Add logic to handle underpayments, leaving an invoice as "PARTIALLY_PAID" and tracking the remaining balance.

Part 3: Overpayments
- Handle overpayments by applying the excess to other outstanding invoices for the same customer.

Part 4: Reporting
- Generate a report showing the status of each invoice (PAID, PARTIALLY_PAID, UNPAID) and the remaining deposit balance.

## Question 2
**Question file:** ledger.py
Stripe-Style Multi-Part Problem: The Unified Ledger Service

This problem simulates a unified ledger service that processes a raw stream of
transaction events. The goal is to maintain correct real-time balances for
merchant accounts and generate payout statements.

The input is a log of ledger events as a single string, with each event
separated by a `|`. The events are not guaranteed to be in chronological order
and must be processed by their `timestamp`.

The format for each event is:
`timestamp;transaction_id;account_id;type;amount;status;linked_id`

- type: CHARGE, REFUND, FEE, or PAYOUT
- status: SUCCEEDED, PENDING, or FAILED

---

Part 1: Final Account Balances
- Calculate the final balance for each account, considering only `SUCCEEDED`
  transactions.

Part 2: Available vs. Total Balance
- Calculate two balances for each account: `total_balance` (including SUCCEEDED
  and PENDING) and `available_balance` (only SUCCEEDED).

Part 3: Dynamic Payout Calculation
- A `PAYOUT` event is a trigger. The service must calculate the payout amount
  based on the account's available balance at that moment. The amount is only
  debited if the payout later succeeds.

Part 4: Generating a Payout Statement
- For a specific SUCCEEDED `payout_id`, generate a chronologically sorted list
  of all transaction IDs that were included in that payout. A transaction is
  included if it was SUCCEEDED and had not been part of a previous successful
  payout.

## Question 3
**Question file:** invoice.py
Stripe’s Invoicing product allows businesses to create and send invoices to their customers. While many invoices can be paid directly, there are cases where standalone payments need to be reconciled with open invoices for a customer.

Your task is to write a program that matches incoming payments to their corresponding invoices based on the payment’s memo line.

You are given:
• A payment string
• A list of invoice strings

The payment string is a comma-separated string containing:

The payment ID (e.g., “payment123”)
The payment amount in USD minor units (e.g., $1.00 = 100)
The memo line, which always follows the format “Paying off: {INVOICE_ID}”
Each invoice string is also comma-separated and contains:

The invoice ID
The due date of the invoice (e.g., “2024-01-01”)
The amount due in USD minor units
You need to:
• Parse the payment and invoices.
• Find the invoice mentioned in the memo line.
• Output a formatted string describing the reconciliation.

Input Example:
payment = "payment5,1000,Paying off: invoiceC"
invoices = [
"invoiceA,2024-01-01,100",
"invoiceB,2024-02-01,200",
"invoiceC,2023-01-30,1000"
]

Expected Output:
payment5 pays off 1000 for invoiceC due on 2023-01-30

## Question 4
**Question file:** Routing.py
Stripe-Style Multi-Part Problem: API Endpoint Versioning and Traffic Routing

This problem simulates an API routing layer at Stripe. The goal is to process
a log containing route deployments and API requests to track which backend service
handles each request based on API versioning rules.

The log is a single string with entries separated by newlines.
- Route Deployment: ROUTE::endpoint={path};versions=[{v1:s1},{v2:s2},...]
- API Request:     REQ::{req_id}::{path}::api_version={version}

Key Rule: A new ROUTE deployment for an endpoint completely replaces any
previous route configuration for that same endpoint.

---

Part 1: Request to Service Mapping
- Process the log to map each request_id to the correct service_name.
- A request is unroutable if its version is not defined for the endpoint at
  the time of the request.

Part 2: Service Traffic Tally
- Count the total number of successful requests handled by each service.

Part 3: Default Version Routing
- Add support for default versions, marked with a '*' (e.g., v2*).
- Requests with a blank api_version should be routed to the default service.

Part 4: Historical Route Analysis Report
- For a specific endpoint, generate a formatted report detailing its entire
  versioning history, showing which services were mapped to which versions
  over time.

## Question 5
**Question file:** merchant.py
Stripe-Style Multi-Part Problem: Merchant Transaction Reconciliation

You are given a long log of transaction strings, each in the format:

  transaction_id:merchant_id:currency:amount:type:timestamp

- The amount is in minor units (e.g., 1000 = $10.00)
- type is either "PAYMENT" or "REFUND"
- timestamp is in ISO 8601 format with time and Z

---

Part 1:
Parse this log and compute how much each merchant has earned, per currency. Output should be grouped by merchant, and currencies sorted alphabetically. Do not filter by time or duplicates.

Example:
    "m1 earned 800 in USD"
    "m2 earned 3000 in EUR"

---

Part 2:
Add support for a cutoff date (YYYY-MM-DD). Only transactions whose date part of the timestamp matches the cutoff should be included.

---

Part 3:
Some transactions may be duplicated (same `transaction_id`). De-duplicate them. Compute merchant earnings per currency, using only unique transactions, and only those on the cutoff date.

---

Part 4:
Generate a formatted reconciliation report:
- Show results grouped by merchant (sorted)
- Within each merchant, list currencies (sorted)
- Only include unique transactions on the cutoff date
- Add a global TOTAL section summing earnings across all merchants per currency

Sample output:

Reconciliation Report for 2025-06-24

Merchant: m1
  USD: 800

Merchant: m2
  EUR: 3000

TOTAL
  EUR: 3000
  USD: 800

## Question 6
**Question file:** sigma_query.py
This file is empty. Please add a relevant Stripe Sigma or SQL query planner question here, such as:
"Stripe Sigma allows users to run SQL queries against their data. Write a function that, given a set of table schemas and a query, determines which tables need to be joined to answer the query, and outputs the join path."

## Question 7
**Question file:** http_headers.py
Part 1
In an HTTP request, the Accept-Language header describes the list of
languages that the requester would like content to be returned in. The header
takes the form of a comma-separated list of language tags. For example:
Accept-Language: en-US, fr-CA, fr-FR
means that the reader would accept:
1. English as spoken in the United States (most preferred)
2. French as spoken in Canada
3. French as spoken in France (least preferred)
We're writing a server that needs to return content in an acceptable language
for the requester, and we want to make use of this header. Our server doesn't
support every possible language that might be requested (yet!), but there is a
set of languages that we do support. Write a function that receives two arguments:
an Accept-Language header value as a string and a set of supported languages,
and returns the list of language tags that will work for the request. The
language tags should be returned in descending order of preference (the
same order as they appeared in the header).
In addition to writing this function, you should use tests to demonstrate that it's
correct, either via an existing testing system or one you create.
Examples:
parseacceptlanguage(
"en-US, fr-CA, fr-FR", # the client's Accept-Language header, a string
["fr-FR", "en-US"] # the server's supported languages, a set of strings
)
returns: ["en-US", "fr-FR"]
parseacceptlanguage("fr-CA, fr-FR", ["en-US", "fr-FR"])
returns: ["fr-FR"]
parseacceptlanguage("en-US", ["en-US", "fr-CA"])
returns: ["en-US"]
parseacceptlanguage("fr-CA, fr-FR", ["en-US", "fr-FR"])
returns: ["fr-FR"]
parseacceptlanguage("en-US", ["en-US", "fr-CA"])
returns: ["en-US"]

## Question 8
**Question file:** leaky_bucket.py
Problem 3: API Rate Limiter (Leaky Bucket)
Story
You are implementing a "leaky bucket" rate limiter to protect a critical API endpoint. Requests of different "sizes" add "water" to a bucket. The bucket leaks at a constant rate. A request is rejected if adding its size would cause the bucket to overflow.

Input Format
A log of API requests separated by ~. Format: timestamp;api_key;request_id;request_size.
Initial parameters: bucket_capacity, leak_rate_per_second.
The Task
Simple Request Counter: Implement a basic rate limiter that only counts the number of requests in the last 60 seconds per api_key.
Leaky Bucket Implementation: Implement the core leaky bucket logic. At the time of each request, calculate how much has leaked, then determine if the new request fits.
Request Outcomes: Process the log chronologically and return a map of each request_id to its outcome: ACCEPTED or REJECTED.
Per-Key Summary: Generate a summary report for each api_key, including total requests received, accepted, and rejected.
Sample Input
requests_log = "2025-01-01T10:00:00Z;key_A;req_1;10~2025-01-01T10:00:00Z;key_A;req_2;15~2025-01-01T10:00:01Z;key_A;req_3;20"
bucket_capacity = 30
leak_rate_per_second = 10

Make sure to sort the events before doing anything

## Question 9
**Question file:** api_versioning.py
Problem: API Version Negotiator
Stripe supports multiple versions of its API and allows clients to specify preferred versions via a custom HTTP header:

yaml
Copy
Edit
X-Stripe-Version: 2022-08-01, latest, 2022-11-01
However, real-world clients might:

Misformat version tags

Use aliases like latest or stable

Have overlapping preferences

You need to write a server-side processor that:

Parses this header

Cleans it

Resolves aliases

Returns the best set of supported versions in correct preference order

## Question 10
**Question file:** currency_conversion.py
Part 1: Parse a string in the format "USD:CAD:DHL:5,USD:GBP:FEDX:10", representing currency conversion rates from a source to a target currency and the associated shipping method. Write a method to convert a given amount from one currency to another. Only direct conversions are allowed.

Part 2: Write a method that returns the cost and shipping methods involved, allowing at most one hop in the conversion from one currency to another.

Part 3: Write a method that returns the minimum cost and involved shipping methods, allowing at most one hop for the conversion.

During the phone screen, I successfully solved the first three parts and ran test cases for each. Unfortunately, I ran out of time before I could get to the fourth part. I coded in C++, though I’d recommend using a language like Python to simplify input parsing.

## Question 11
**Question file:** parse_application.py
Part 1:
You are given a string representing application IDs in the following format:

Each application ID is prefixed by its length (number of characters in the ID).
The format is: lengthOfApplicationId + APPLICATION_ID + ... + 0 (ends with a 0).
Example:
Input: 10A13414124218B124564356434567430
Output: ["A134141242", "B12456435643456743"]

Part 2:
Filter the application IDs obtained from Part 1 to return only the "whitelisted" application IDs.

Example:
Input: 10A13414124218B124564356434567430, ["A134141242"]
Output: ["A134141242"]

Question : https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6135840/stripe-phone-interview-experience-by-ano-3rgj/

Thing to know : AST Used ast.literal_eval() to safely convert a string like "['A134141242']" into an actual Python list.

## Question 12
**Question file:** webhook_delivery.py
Problem 11: Webhook Delivery Attempt Simulator
Story
When an event occurs, Stripe sends a "webhook" notification to a user's server. If the server fails to respond, Stripe retries with an exponential backoff delay. You are building a simulator for this logic.

Input Format
A list of webhook events to be sent, format: event_id;url.
Retry policy parameters: initial_delay_seconds, max_retries.
A log of server responses, separated by &. Format: timestamp;event_id;http_status. 200 is a success.
The Task
Initial Delivery Status: Determine if each event's first delivery attempt was a success or failure.
Retry Schedule: For every event that initially failed, generate a schedule of when subsequent retries should have occurred.
Final Event Status: Determine the final status for each event: DELIVERED or FAILED.
Unreliable Endpoints: An "unreliable" url is one that failed to accept an event more than 3 times in a row for any single event. Identify all unreliable URLs.
Sample Input
events_to_send = ["evt_A;http://endpoint.com/a", "evt_B;http://endpoint.com/b"]
policy = {"initial_delay_seconds": 60, "max_retries": 3}
response_log = "2025-08-01T12:00:00Z;evt_A;503&2025-08-01T12:01:00Z;evt_A;503&2025-08-01T12:02:00Z;evt_B;200&2025-08-01T12:03:00Z;evt_A;200"

## Question 13
**Question file:** transfer_reversal.py
Write a program to track the status and impact of money transfers and reversals for Stripe accounts. Given a log of transfer and reversal events (with event type, transfer ID, account ID, and amount), your program should:
- Determine the final status of each transfer (PAID, FAILED, or REVERSED)
- Calculate the final balance impact for each account
- For reversed transfers, compute the time between creation and reversal
- Identify high-risk accounts (where more than 20% of transfers were reversed)

## Question 14
**Question file:** balance_report.py
Problem 13: Top-Up Balance and Threshold Alerts
Story
Some Stripe products require a user to maintain a "top-up" balance from which fees are deducted. You are building a monitoring service to send alerts when a balance drops below a threshold.

Input Format
A log of balance-affecting events, separated by |. Format: timestamp;account_id;type;amount.
type: TOP_UP (adds), FEE (subtracts).
An alert_threshold value.
The Task
Final Balances: Process all events and calculate the final balance for each account.
Balance History: For a specific account, return its entire balance history (timestamp and balance after each event).
Threshold Alert Generation: Identify every time an account's balance crosses the threshold from above to below. Return a list of all alerts.
"At Risk" Report: An account is "at risk" if it has dropped below the threshold more than twice. Generate a list of all "at risk" accounts.
Sample Input
balance_log = "2025-09-01T10:00:00Z;acct_A;TOP_UP;10000|2025-09-02T11:00:00Z;acct_A;FEE;3000|2025-09-03T12:00:00Z;acct_A;FEE;3000"
alert_threshold = 5000

## Question 15
**Question file:** subscription_tier.py
Write a program to assign SaaS users to subscription tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold) based on their monthly usage. Given tier boundaries and a log of daily usage events, your program should:
- Calculate total monthly usage for each customer
- Assign the correct subscription tier for each month
- Generate notifications for tier changes between months
- Project each customer's tier based on usage so far in the current month

## Question 16
**Question file:** checkout_item_session.py
Write a program to process a Stripe Checkout session log. Given a log of events (item added/removed, coupon applied, purchase confirmed), your program should:
- Track the contents and quantities of items in the cart
- Calculate the subtotal and apply discounts
- Output the final order summary, including items, subtotal, discount, and total 

## Question 17
**Question file:** document_verification.py
Write a program to track the document verification process for company applications. Given a log of document events (upload, verification, failure) and a list of required documents, your program should:
- Determine the final status of each document (UPLOADED, VERIFIED, FAILED)
- Determine the overall application status for each company (COMPLETE, ACTION_REQUIRED, PENDING)
- List missing or unverified documents for incomplete applications
- Generate a detailed report for each company, including document statuses and overall application status 

## Question 18

- Calculate the monthly bill for each customer based on their final plan
- (Advanced) Calculate prorated charges for customers who change plans mid-month
- (Bonus) Generate a detailed invoice for each customer, listing line items for each plan segment and the total amount due 

## Question 23
**Question file:** accounting_engine.py
Stripe-Style Multi-Part Problem: Connect Platform Fee Calculator

This problem simulates the core accounting engine for a marketplace platform built on Stripe Connect. The goal is to process a log of charges to accurately calculate platform fees and the net amount owed to sellers.

The input is a single log string with charges separated by '~'.

The charge format is:
`transaction_id;connected_account_id;amount;currency;charge_type`
- charge_type: Can be `DIRECT` or `DESTINATION`.

---

Part 1: Gross Transaction Volume
- Calculate the total gross volume for each seller, ignoring fees.

Part 2: Net Payouts with a Flat Fee
- Calculate the total net payout for each seller after a flat 2% platform fee is deducted from all transactions.

Part 3: Differentiated Fee Structure
- Update the logic for a new fee structure: 2% for `DESTINATION` charges and 0.5% for `DIRECT` charges.

Part 4: Currency-Specific Reporting
- Generate a comprehensive report for each seller that breaks down their `gross_volume` and `net_payout` per currency. 

## Question 24
**Question file:** digital_contracts.py
📝 Question: Digital Contract Action Tracker
You are building a system to track user activity on digital contracts. Each log entry captures when a user has viewed, signed, or forwarded a contract. These logs arrive in a semi-structured string format. You are expected to process these logs and extract actionable insights.

Each log is separated by a semicolon (`;`) and is of the form:
  contract_id|user_id|action|timestamp

Actions are one of: "VIEWED", "SIGNED", or "FORWARDED".

Part 1: Parse the input logs and return a dictionary mapping each contract_id to a list of action events (sorted by timestamp).
Part 2: For each contract, print the last action performed with this format: Contact {contract_id} last action {action} by {user_id} at {time}
Part 3: Return a list of contract_ids where the actions appear out-of-order. The valid order is: VIEWED → SIGNED → FORWARDED.
Part 4: Generate a readable report for each contract showing all actions chronologically. 

## Question 25
**Question file:** dispute_resolution.py
Stripe-Style Multi-Part Problem: Dispute Resolution Ledger

This problem involves processing a log of payment dispute events to track the status and financial impact on merchants. The input is a single string where events are separated by '&'. The event format is:
`dispute_id/merchant_id/transaction_id/timestamp/event_type/amount_minor/metadata`

Part 1: Dispute State Tracking
- Determine the final status of each dispute (`WON`, `LOST`, or `UNDER_REVIEW`) based on its most recent event by timestamp.

Part 2: Initial Financial Impact
- Calculate the net financial impact on each merchant. An `OPEN` event debits the amount from the merchant, and a `WON` event credits it back.

Part 3: Non-Refundable Dispute Fees
- Modify the calculation to include a fixed, non-refundable fee that is debited from the merchant when a dispute is opened.

Part 4: Merchant Reconciliation Report
- Generate a formatted report for a specified merchant, detailing each dispute's status, reason, individual impact, and the total net impact for the merchant. 

## Question 26
**Question file:** shipment_tracker.py
Problem: Shipment Event Tracker

You are building a shipment event tracker that processes raw event strings and supports generating meaningful reports. The events are given as a single string where each event is delimited by a semicolon (`;`). Each event has the following format:
    <shipment_id>|<carrier>|<status>|<timestamp>

Status Normalization:
Since status updates come from various systems, the status can be inconsistent. You must normalize statuses to one of the following:
- "PICKED_UP" (includes: "pickup", "collected", "PICKED_UP")
- "IN_TRANSIT" (includes: "in_transit", "moving", "ON_THE_WAY")
- "DELIVERED" (includes: "delivered", "DELIVERED")

Your Task: Implement the following features

Part 1: Parse all events and group them by shipment ID, normalize the statuses, sort events for each shipment by timestamp, and return a dictionary of shipments and their sorted status timelines (status + timestamp).
Part 2: Generate a user-friendly status report: one section per shipment, with carrier and sorted status history.
Part 3: Remove duplicate event entries (identical event strings), then parse and sort as in Part 1.
Part 4: From the unique events, get the most recent status per shipment based on timestamp. 


## Question 27

**Question file:** flatten\_json.py
Stripe-Style Problem: JSON Event Flattening

Stripe logs API activity in a deeply nested JSON structure. You are building a log parser that flattens the nested structure into dot-delimited key-value pairs.

**Input:** A string containing a JSON object (nested dictionaries and lists allowed).

---

Part 1 – Flattening:

* Write a function to flatten any nested JSON. Keys should be dot-separated, with list indices in brackets.

Example:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 123,
    "metadata": {
      "plan": "gold"
    }
  },
  "events": [
    {"type": "login"},
    {"type": "payment", "amount": 500}
  ]
}
```

Should become:

```json
{
  "user.id": 123,
  "user.metadata.plan": "gold",
  "events[0].type": "login",
  "events[1].type": "payment",
  "events[1].amount": 500
}
```

---

Part 2 – Field Filter:

* Allow the function to take a list of fields to extract. Only return those flattened keys.

Part 3 – Schema Validation:

* Write a method that checks whether all required fields exist in the flattened result.

## Question 28

**Question file:** log\_diff.py
Stripe-Style Problem: Event Log Reconciliation

You’re given two logs: `internal_log`, `external_log`, both as strings where each event is formatted as:
`event_id;timestamp;amount`

---

Part 1 – Matching Events:

* Return a list of event\_ids that exist in one log but not the other.

Part 2 – Mismatched Fields:

* If both logs contain the same `event_id`, but the `amount` differs, include it in a `mismatched` report.

Part 3 – Timestamp Drift:

* Detect events where timestamps differ by more than 5 minutes. Return these as potential clock sync issues.

## Question 29

**Question file:** csv\_summary.py
Stripe-Style Problem: CSV-Based Invoice Aggregator

You are given a CSV string representing invoice data with the format:
`invoice_id,merchant_id,currency,amount,timestamp`

---

Part 1 – Totals per Merchant:

* Return total revenue per merchant per currency.

Part 2 – Daily Aggregates:

* Return per-day revenue totals for a specified currency.

Part 3 – Range Filter:

* Add support for filtering only rows between a given start\_date and end\_date.

Part 4 – Currency Conversion:

* Add support to convert to USD using a provided rate map `{ "EUR": 1.1, "CAD": 0.8 }`.

## Question 30

**Question file:** usage\_duration.py
Stripe-Style Problem: Session Duration Calculator

You’re given a log of usage events (login/logout) per user:
`timestamp;user_id;event_type`
Where event\_type is either `LOGIN` or `LOGOUT`.

---

Part 1 – Duration per Session:

* For each user, calculate the duration of each session (LOGOUT - LOGIN).

Part 2 – Monthly Usage Report:

* Aggregate total usage time per user per month.

Part 3 – Abnormal Sessions:

* Detect users with sessions longer than 24 hours (likely caused by missing logouts).

## Question 31

**Question file:** pagination\_simulator.py
Stripe-Style Problem: Paginated API Simulator

Stripe returns API results in pages with a `next_cursor`. You need to simulate paginated access.

You’re given a large list of transaction records (list of dicts), a page size, and an optional cursor.

---

Part 1 – Page Fetch:

* Implement a function that returns one page of results and the next cursor.

Part 2 – Filtering:

* Support filtering results by a field (e.g., status = “SUCCEEDED”).

Part 3 – Cursor Resumption:

* Support restarting from a given cursor (index-based or record-based).
