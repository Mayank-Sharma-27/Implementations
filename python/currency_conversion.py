""" 
Part 1: Parse a string in the format "USD:CAD:DHL:5,USD:GBP:FEDX:10", representing currency conversion rates from a source to a target currency and the associated shipping method. Write a method to convert a given amount from one currency to another. Only direct conversions are allowed.

Part 2: Write a method that returns the cost and shipping methods involved, allowing at most one hop in the conversion from one currency to another.

Part 3: Write a method that returns the minimum cost and involved shipping methods, allowing at most one hop for the conversion.

During the phone screen, I successfully solved the first three parts and ran test cases for each. Unfortunately, I ran out of time before I could get to the fourth part. I coded in C++, though Iâ€™d recommend using a language like Python to simplify input parsing. """
